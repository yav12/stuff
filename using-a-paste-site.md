If you are reading this, something is probably gone wrong. Minecraft for some reason has crashed on you and you dont know what to do. To be able to properly diagnose the problem, you need to have a look at a crash report or a log file. This guide is to help you get help by uploading that log so that you can share it with (hopefullly) more knowledgable people. 

## Some notes about this guide
I tried to include as many pictures as i could and for different operating systems. Some things may look little different, but you should hopefully be able to recognize what they are (mainly file explorer looking a little different). [Paste.ee](https://paste.ee/) is often flagged as a malicous website by antivirus browser extensions (most notably malwarebytes). This is not the case, but if it makes you uncomfortable, you can one of the other options. 

## MultiMC/PolyMC
If you are using MultiMC or its fork, PolyMC, There is no need for you to locate the log file and upload it, the launcher does all this for you!
First open up MultiMC select the modpack you want to get a log for (single click not double click). Then click edit instance and then navigate to "Other Logs."

From this menu, you can access all the logs that minecraft has produced for this instance. by clicking the dropdown (where my cursor is in the screenshot) you can select a log. Pick the one you want, and then press upload. A confirmation message will appear, and it will copy the link to your log to your clipboard. Skip down to [Sharing the log](#sharing-the-log) :>

## Finding the log
To upload a log, you need to be able to find it first. The instructions are pretty similar between launchers.

The first step is to open the main page of the minecraft modpacks page in the launcher you are using. You should see a list of installed modpacks where you can choose to play or modifiy a pack. (need an image for curseforge)

Right-click the image of the modpack you wish to get a log from, and select open Minecraft folder (it might say open instance folder). 
once you are in file explorer, navigate to logs folder and select the crash-reports folder or the log (depending on what you are looking for). Then open the log/report you want. Logs other than the latest.log will be saved as .gz archives and can be extracted using software like [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), [tar](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html), or [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/), all of which I highly recommend. 


## Uploading the Log
To be able to share your log file, you need to put it somewhere on the internet where people can access it. Thats where paste sites come in. They offer a free place to place text for others to access for a limited time (or forever if you want).
