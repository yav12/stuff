download [this](https://github.com/oureveryday/Steam-auto-crack/releases/download/3.2.2/SteamAutoCrack.zip) (downloads a thing) and unzip it, then run the executable in there

you then fill out the top two fields (the rest arent necessary, but you can fill them out if you like): 

path is wherever you put the folder you copied, something like this:

when its done (shouldnt take too long) you can delete it
